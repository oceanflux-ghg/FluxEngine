# OceanFlux Greenhouse Gases default climatology configuration file
 # created 12/12/2012 Jamie Shutler, jams@pml.ac.uk
 #
 # note: use of '=' between the variable name and its value/path/string etc is optional
 # note: all entries are required
 
 #
 # Input datasets and identifiers, path/location definition needed for all entries
 # Required input dataset names are: windu10, sstskin, sstfnd, ecmwf, pco2, sigma0, sig_wv_ht
 # The data product name is the name of the data set within the netcdf file. This can be checked using 'ncdump -h <file.nc> | less'
 # An example file is '20100101_OCF-SST-GLO-1M-100-MGD-OSTIA.nc' , where the data identifier is 'MGD-OSTIA' and data product name is
 # 'analysed_sst_mean'
 #
 # Issues to note: 
 #  - all entries are needed
 #  - entries should start 'OCEANFLUX-DATA/'
 #  - the ~/ need to be kept as these specify your home directory
 #  - the filename structure of these datasets is assumed within the perl program, so if you decide to use an unusual dataset
 #    then you may need to edit the perl to account for this.
