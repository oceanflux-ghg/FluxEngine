#
# Input datasets and identifiers, path/location definition needed for all entries
# Required input dataset names are: windu10, sstskin, sstfnd, ecmwf, pco2, sigma0, sig_wv_ht
# The data product name is the name of the data set within the netcdf file. This can be checked using 'ncdump -h <file.nc> | less'
# An example file is '20100101_OCF-SST-GLO-1M-100-MGD-OSTIA.nc' , where the data identifier is 'MGD-OSTIA' and data product name is
# 'analysed_sst_mean'
#
# Issues to note:
#  - All entries are case sensitive
#  - 
#
# Filepaths can contain the following tokens:
#    <YYYY>  - converted to 4 digit year, e.g. 1999
#    <YY>    - converted to 2 digit year, e.g.   99
#    <MM>	 - converted to two digit month, e.g. 01 for January
#	 <Mmm>	 - converted to three letter month abbreviation, e.g. Jan for January
#    <MMM>	 - uppercase three letter month abbreviation, e.g. JAN
#    <mmm>	 - lowercase three letter month abbreviation, e.g. jan
#	 <DD>	 - two digit decimal representation of the day of the month, e.g. 01 for the 1st day of the month
#	 <DDD>	 - three digit decimal representation of the day of the year, e.g. 123 for 3rd May (124 on a leap year)
#
# In addition to these tokens, filename patterns can be specified using ? and * which
# follow the standard Unix glob behaviour.
#

# will be derived according to, i.e.:

# At least one must be selected.

# 
# Input data layers and their associated data variable names
# 
# Each input data layer is specified by its names and at least a path # and prod (netCDF
# variable name) using the name followed by a '_path' or '_prod' suffix, respectively. E.g.:
# sstskin_path = path/to/data.nc
# sstskin_prod = sst_skin_mean
# 
# Other suffixes can be used:
#   _path		    - Filepath to the netCDF (.nc) file containing this data.
#				      May be relative or absolute and can contain the tokens described above.
#	_prod           - The name of the variable within the netCDF file.
#	_stddev_prod    - Optional. Name of the variable containing standard deviation data.
#	_count_prod	    - Optional. Name of the variable containing count data.
#   _netCDFName     - Optional. Override the name which will be given to the data layer in the
#					- output netCDF file.
#	_minBound	    - Optional. Override the minimum allowed value.
#	_maxBound	    - Optional. Override the maximum allowed value.
#   _preprocessing	- Optional. A list of functions used to transform the data before it is used.
#					- Functions should be seperated by commas and are applied in order.
#					- Functions must be defined in src_home/data_preprocessing.py
